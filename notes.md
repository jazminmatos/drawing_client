### Flow of User Submission:

- index.js:
  - new instance of UserService (i.e. URL) is created
  - user clicks submit
  - Call .getUser() on UserService instance
- userservice.js:
  - .getUser() runs a fetch GET request to retrieve usernames from backend
    - JSON is parsed
      - iterate through JSON object to find (or filter if usernames != unique?) username === value of input field
      - if not found...
        - send a POST request to backend
        - retrieve it using a GET request
        - create a new User instance (b/c now it will have an id)
        - append it to the DOM
      - else if found...
        - look for it in User.all (might be a problem if names != unique)
        - append it to the DOM
- user.js:
  - handles the creation of the user instance
- userservice.js:
  - append the instance onto the DOM using the putOnDom() instance method
- user.js:
  - handles putOnDOM() instance method
    - uses userHTML() instance method to format the HTML and append it to the DOM
